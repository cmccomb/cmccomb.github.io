Hi! I'm an Assistant Professor of Engineering Design in [SEDTAPP](https://www.sedtapp.psu.edu) at Penn State, and one of two directors of the [Technology and Human Research in Engineering Design (THRED) Group](http://thred.group). I also have the pleasure of courtesy appointments in the [mechanical engineering](https://www.me.psu.edu) and [industrial engineering](https://www.ime.psu.edu) departments, and serve as an affiliate faculty of the [Institute for Computational and Data Sciences](https://ics.psu.edu) and the [Stuckeman Center for Design Computing](https://stuckeman.psu.edu/SCDC). 

In my research I draw on perspectives from engineering, design, and psychology to study how humans act while solving problems. Within this regime, I explore the spectrum between human teams and computational agent teams, creating advanced design algorithms and cognitive support tools. In addition to design research, I'm interested in machine learning, STEM education, design automation, and design for the developing world.

I received my graduate degrees in mechanical engineering from Carnegie Mellon (PhD '16, MS '14), and a dual undergraduate degree in civil and mechanical engineering from Fresno State (BS '12).
