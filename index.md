Hi! I'm an Assistant Professor of Engineering Design and Mechanical Engineering at Penn State, and the director of the <a href="http://thred.group">Technology and Human Research in Engineering Design (THRED) Group</a>.  In my research I draw on perspectives from engineering, design, and psychology to study how humans act while solving problems. Within this regime, I explore the spectrum between human teams and computational agent teams, creating advanced design algorithms and cognitive support tools. In addition to design research, I'm interested in machine learning, STEM education, optimization, and design for the developing world.

I received my graduate degrees in mechanical engineering from Carnegie Mellon (PhD '16, MS '14), and a dual undergraduate degree in civil and mechanical engineering from Fresno State (BS '12).
