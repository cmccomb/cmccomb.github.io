Hi! I'm an Assistant Professor of Engineering Design Mechanical Engineering at Penn State.  My research draws on perspectives from engineering, design, and psychology to study how humans act while solving problems, and how that activity changes in teams. I perform these investigations through cognitive experiments with real design teams as well as computational experiments with simulated design teams. In addition to design methodology, I'm interested in machine learning, STEM education, optimization, and design for the developing world.

I received my graduate degrees in mechanical engineering from Carnegie Mellon (PhD '16, MS '14), and a dual undergraduate degree in civil and mechanical engineering from Fresno State (BS '12).
