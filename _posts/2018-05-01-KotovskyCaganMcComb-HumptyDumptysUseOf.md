This extended abstract explores fundamental assumptions of engineering design methodology and theory that are called into question by recent work. This piece is centered around four questions that highlight the assumptions that we explore. These are (1) Are teams teams? (2) Is search good? (3) Are analogies analogous? and (4) Is novelty novel? Our intent is to generate critical discourse around these topics and encourage the community to continue to challenge underlying assumptions.
