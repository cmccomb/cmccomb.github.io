This note explores fundamental assumptions of engineering design methodology and theory that are called into question by recent work. This piece is centered around five questions that highlight the assumptions that we explore. These are (1) Are teams teams? (2) Is search good? (3) Are analogies analogous? and (4) Is novelty novel? (5) Is fixation fixated?  Our intent is to generate critical discourse around these topics and encourage the community to continue to challenge underlying assumptions.
