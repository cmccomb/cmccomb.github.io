Crowdsourced competitions have seen increased used for software development and data science, and platforms often encourage teamwork between participants. This is unsurprising - teams are ubiquitous, woven into the fabric of engineering and design. Often, it is assumed that teams are better at solving problems than individuals working independently. However, recent work in engineering, design, and psychology has indicated that teams may not be the problem-solving panacea that they were once thought to be. This work undertakes an analysis of the performance of different team styles and sizes in crowdsourced data science competitions. This work demonstrates that groups of individuals working independently may outperform interacting teams on average, but that small interacting teams are more likely to win competitions. These results are discussed in the context of motivation for crowdsourcing participants, and semantic analysis of forum posts is presented to uncover the internal machinery of both and high- and low-performing teams.
