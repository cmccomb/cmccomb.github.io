Design often involves searching for a solution by iteratively modifying and adjusting a current design. Through this process, designers improve the quality of the current design as well as learning what patterns of operations are most likely to lead to the quickest future improvements. Prior work in psychology has shown that humans can be adept at learning how to apply short sequences of operations for maximum effect while solving a problem. This work explores the sequencing of operations specifically within the domain of engineering design by examining the results of two human studies in which participants created solutions to configuration design problems. First, a statistical analysis of the data from those studies uses Markov chains to show that meaningful operation sequences exist, and can be accurately described using first-order models. Second, this work uses an agent-based modeling framework in conjunction with Markov chain concepts to simulate the performance of teams with and without the ability to learn sequences. These computational studies confirm the assumption that sequence-learning abilities are helpful during design.
