---
Earlier this afternoon I successfully defended my dissertation, entitled "Designing the Characteristics of Design Teams via Cognitively Inspired Computational Modeling". I am immensely grateful for my phenomenal committee members: [Jonathan Cagan](https://www.cmu.edu/me/people/jonathan-cagan.html), [Kenneth Kotovsky](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/people/core-training-faculty/kotovsky-kenneth.html), [Kenji Shimada](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/shimada/), and [Kristina Shea](http://www.edac.ethz.ch/the-group/people-new/shea--kristina--prof--dr-.html/).
