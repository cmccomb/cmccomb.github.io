In engineering education, the goal is not only to teach the technical engineering skills but to positively influence students’ identity development to enhance future success. Often, first-year engineering classes that have a large formative role in students’ academic careers are taught using a project-based learning approach. However, the effect of such courses on the growth and development of students’ engineering identity has not been studied in detail. This work studied the growth of engineering identity of 15 weeks in one such course. Engineering identity was assessed through several engineering identity instruments as well as the use of natural language processing.
